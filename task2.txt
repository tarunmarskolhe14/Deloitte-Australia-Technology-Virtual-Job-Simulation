## 📝 **Task Two: Development — Software Development Proposal**

### ⏱ Estimated Time: 1-2 hours

---

### 🎯 **Objective**

Translate the client's business needs into a **clear, actionable proposal** for developing a dashboard to monitor machine health across multiple factory sites.

---

### 📚 **What I Learned**

* How to convert **client requirements into a structured technical proposal**.
* How to communicate technical recommendations in **clear, non-technical language**.
* How to address **key factors in software development**: security, scalability, UI/UX, and timelines.
* How to structure a **client-facing document** to align with professional consulting standards.

---

### 💡 **What I Did**

✅ Reviewed the client’s requirements for a **private dashboard solution** within their secure intranet.
✅ Prepared a formal written proposal addressing:

* **Business Problem:** Need for real-time visibility of machine health metrics across 4 factories.
* **Proposed Solution:** A secure, web-based dashboard accessible only within the company’s intranet.
* **Architecture Overview:** Data sources (telemetry logs), processing (Python/ETL pipelines), storage (SQL/NoSQL), and front-end visualization (React / Tableau).
* **Security Considerations:** Role-based access control (RBAC), internal network access restrictions.
* **User Interface:** Clean, intuitive design focusing on KPIs (uptime, performance, alerts).
* **Timeline & Deliverables:** Phased delivery plan from requirement gathering through to deployment.
* **Benefits:** Improved operational oversight, proactive maintenance, centralized monitoring.
