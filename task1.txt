## 📝 **Task One: Coding — Data Model Unification**

### 🎯 **Objective**

Develop a Python-based solution to reconcile and unify **two distinct data models** provided in JSON format, simulating a real-world consulting problem where client data exists in different structures.

### 📚 **What I Learned**

* How to interpret and align inconsistent data sources.
* How to build **Python scripts** for data parsing, cleaning, and merging.
* Practical exposure to **data reconciliation** challenges faced by technology consultants.
* The importance of producing clean, standardized outputs from inconsistent inputs.

---

### 💻 **What I Did**

✅ Analyzed two different JSON data models representing similar information in varying formats.
✅ Wrote a **Python algorithm** to:

* Read both JSON files.
* Extract relevant fields from each structure.
* Normalize data keys and formats.
* Merge the datasets into a single, unified structure.

✅ Ensured the final output met a **standardized schema** suitable for downstream processes or client reporting.

### 🔍 **Sample Python Snippet**

```python
import json

with open('data-1.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file1, open('data-2.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file2:
    data1 = json.load(file1)
    data2 = json.load(file2)

# Normalize and unify
unified_data = []

for entry in data1 + data2:
    unified_entry = {
        'id': entry.get('id') or entry.get('identifier'),
        'name': entry.get('name') or entry.get('fullName'),
        'email': entry.get('emailAddress') or entry.get('email'),
        'phone': entry.get('contactNumber') or entry.get('phone')
    }
    unified_data.append(unified_entry)

with open('unified_data.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outfile:
    json.dump(unified_data, outfile, indent=4)

print("Unified data saved to unified_data.json.")
```

### 📂 **Deliverable**

**`unified_data.json`**

> A clean, consistent JSON dataset combining fields from both original models, ready for use in reporting, analysis, or system migration.
