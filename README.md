## 📝 **Task One: Coding — Data Model Unification**

### ⏱ Estimated Time: 30-60 minutes

### 🎯 **Objective**

Develop a Python-based solution to reconcile and unify **two distinct JSON data models**, simulating a real-world problem where clients need to consolidate inconsistent data sources.

### 💡 **What I Learned**

* Data reconciliation strategies using Python.
* Working with JSON data parsing and transformation.
* Structuring outputs to meet business requirements.

### 💻 **What I Did**

* Parsed two separate JSON datasets with different schemas.
* Normalized and merged data into a **single unified structure**.
* Exported the unified dataset for further analysis or reporting.

### 📂 **Deliverable**

**`unified_data.json`**

> A clean, standardized JSON file combining both original datasets.

## 📝 **Task Two: Development — Software Development Proposal**

### ⏱ Estimated Time: 1-2 hours

### 🎯 **Objective**

Prepare a professional proposal for developing a **secure internal dashboard** for monitoring IIoT-enabled machine health across Daikibo Industrials' four factories.

### 💡 **What I Learned**

* Translating business needs into technical solutions.
* Communicating complex systems clearly for non-technical audiences.
* Structuring proposals with security, scalability, and maintainability in mind.

### 💻 **What I Did**

* Proposed a **single-page dashboard application** with the following features:

  * Internal-only access via corporate intranet.
  * Single sign-on (SSO) with internal authentication (LDAP / Active Directory).
  * Health monitoring for 36 machines across 4 factories.
  * Expandable hierarchy and visual status indicators.
* Outlined a secure architecture with HTTPS and access control.
* Provided a clear timeline and effort breakdown (125 man-hours).
* Defined ongoing support plans for bug fixes, maintenance, and feature enhancements.

### 📂 **Deliverable**

**`Software Development Proposal.pdf`**

> A detailed technical proposal outlining project scope, architecture, deliverables, timeline, and support.
